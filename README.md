# fcn_segmentation
In this project i implemented fcn32s and fcn8s from scratch for the task of semantic segmentation . i trained the model on CamVid dataset.

result metrics - 
iou in fcn 8s -  0.3872870561793166
mean accuracy in fcn 8s -  0.7741428788965246
pixelwise accuracy in fcn 8s -  0.8902169921874998



iou in fcn 32s -  0.33139500959453305
mean accuracy in fcn 32s -  0.7245959772991014
pixelwise accuracy in fcn 32s -  0.8706499348958332

The models are available through the kaggle notebook .
